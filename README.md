# SQl-Employee_Performance
ScienceQtech is a startup. With the annual appraisal cycle around the corner, the HR department has to generate reports on employee details, their performance 
and on the project that the employees have undertaken, to analyze the employee database and extract specific data based on different requirements.

Objective:

To facilitate a better understanding, managers have provided ratings for each employee which will help the HR department to finalize the employee performance mapping. 
I am finding the maximum salary of the employees and ensure that all jobs are meeting the organization's profile standard. 
I am calculating bonuses to find extra cost for expenses. 
This will raise the overall performance of the organization by ensuring that all required employees receive training for getting into higher management profile .
